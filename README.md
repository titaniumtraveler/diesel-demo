# diesel-demo

A small test project I created to learn diesel.

It is based on [this](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started) guide from
the official diesel website.

It contains two versions:

- the normal synchronous
- and the asynchronous using [`diesel_async`](https://docs.rs/diesel-async/latest)

It was surprisingly easy to port from the synchronous version to the
asynchronous one and diesel in general seems to a be really fun crate. \
I will definitely use that in my next project that needs a database.
